Introduction
  Figgie is a food specific photo sharing app, which allows users to share photos of dishes they have eaten, and save photos to favourites for future reference.

  The app is designed for millenials who like eating out and want to know what their meal will look like before they order. The app is aimed at taking the guess work out of ordering and also encourage users to try new places.

  With the ability to search across different venues, categories and cuisines, users are able to find the meal they are looking for!

Lessons learned / wins
  * Try not to do too many things at once (keep things simple at first)
  * Be clear on what you want to achieve, and build up off that
  * Get the basics done once (and done right) and go from there. But in saying that, I learnt a LOT about the interrelationship of models and associations in rails
